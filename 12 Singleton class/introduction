Singleton class
---------------
Singleton class is a class which can have only one object at a time, and after first time if we try to create another object then the new reference variable points to the previously object created. 

Rules to define singleton class : 

1. Make constructor private 
2. Make a static method, which returns object of that specific singleton class. 

We can deal with singleton class by two ways : 
a. Eager initialization (also perform with static block)
b. Lazy initialization
