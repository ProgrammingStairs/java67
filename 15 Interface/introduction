Interface
----------
1. Interface is also used to achieve abstraction
2. With the help of interface we can achieve 100% abstraction till jdk7
3. Interface is used to achieve loose coupling 
4. Interface is used to achieve the functionality of multiple inheritance 
5. We can use implements keyword to implement interface 
6. Interface is represented by interface keyword followed by interface name 
7. Class implements interface, whereas interface extends interfsace 
8. By default data members inside interface is public static final and member methods are public abstract
9. From jdk8, we can create concrete methods(methods with definition part) inside interface with the help of default and static keyword 
10.  From jdk9, we can create private method inside interface 
11. With the help of interface, abstract class and normal class, we can create anonymous class but priority goes with interface to create anonymous class 
12. syntax : 
        interface Showable{
            int age=19; // by default public static final 
            void show(); // by default public abstract
        }
13. We can also create functional interface by putting @FunctionalInterface annotation
Functional interface means, the interface which contains only one abstract method.

14. Functional Interface is required when we deal with lambda expression.
