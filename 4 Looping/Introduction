Looping : Looping is the process of performing same task or some task in an iterative manner, untill certain condition is satisfied. 

There are two types of loops : 
a. Entry control loop
b. Exit control loop

a. Entry control loop
In case of Entry control loop, condition is checked at the time of entry. 
Here for loop and while loop comes under this category.

b. Exit Control loop
In case of Exit control loop, condition is checked at the time of exit. 
Here do while loop comes under this category.

for loop : When we already know in advance that how many times we have to execute our loop, then in that case we are going to use for loop.
Ex : table of a number 

while loop : When we don't know in advance that how many times we have to execute our loop, then in that case we are going to use while loop
Ex : Reversing a number 

do while loop : Whether condition is true or false, do while loop may executes atleast once.
