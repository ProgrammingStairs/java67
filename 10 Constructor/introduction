Constructor : 
-------------
1. Constructor is the special member function
2. Name of constructor is same as class Name
3. Constructor does not return any value not even void
4. Constructor will be called automatically, whenever object of a class is created 
5. Initial work of constructor is to construct object. 
6. JVM is responsible for assigning default initial values to instance variable
7. Constructor chaining is possible in java 
8. Types of constructor : 
    a. Default constructor (runs by the system internally)
    b. No-argument constructor (explicitly defined by the programmer)
    c. Parameterized constructor 
    d. Copy constructor (We can perform the concept of copying data into another object through Parameterized constructor | or explicitly)
       Here we have two concepts while copying data into another object : 
       i. shallow copy
       ii. deep copy 

Note : default copy constructor is absent in java
