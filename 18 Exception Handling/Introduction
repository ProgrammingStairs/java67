Exception Handling : 
-------------------
Exceptions are the run time anomalies(unexpected situation), which may arise during the execution of program, and the mechanism of handling such type of execptions are known as Exception handling mechanism. 

Exception Handling mechanism includes : 
1. Find the problem(Hit the exception)
2. Inform that error has occured(Throw the exception)
3. Receive the error information(Catch the exception)
4. Take corrective measure(Handle the exception)

There are 5 keywords used in exception handling : 
    a. try      b. catch     c. throw    d. throws     e. finally

out of this, try catch and finally are blocks whereas throw and throws are keywords.

Syntax: 
    try{
        ....
    }catch(Exception e){
        ....
    }

    try with multiple catch : 
        try{
            ....
        }catch(Exception_1 e){
            .....
        }catch(Exception_2 e){
            .....
        }catch(Exception_3 e){
            .....
        }

    try with generalized catch : 
        try{
            ....
        }catch(Exception_1 | Exception_2 | Exception_3 ex){
            .....
        }

    try with resource 

    try(class_name obj = new class_name()){

    }catch(Exception e){
